# BigDebuffs

This is an addon designed to optimize your experience by hooking into unit frames, replacing portraits with duration timers whenever important auras are present, ensuring you have immediate visibility of key effects.

With [**BigDebuffs**](#), you can enhance your situational awareness and improve your gameplay!
